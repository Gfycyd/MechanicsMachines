### Goal KinematicsGripper.m: 
#### Find angles alpha, beta, gamma(as angles which is changing with time of mech.work, we consider this angles with resprect to OX coordinate Frame) and velocity and acceleration of an end-effector(for us, we want it for joint E) with knowa links lenght, w and step screw thread, not take forces into account.
